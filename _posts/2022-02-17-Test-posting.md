* Scrum is one of the ways to implement agile.

* iterative philosophy : iterate over the changes and deployments for software developments (Plan - Build - Test - Review)

* Product Owner(Manager) who holds the responsibility to make sure that the application is being deployed and build as planned.

* Scrum Master(Team Leader) : handles day-to-day operations, running the meetings, handling the tasks

* Developer, Tester etc(Teammates)


* Product Backlog vs Sprint Backlog
